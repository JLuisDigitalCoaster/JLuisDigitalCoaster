- 👋 Hi, I’m @JLuisDigitalCoaster
- 👨‍💻 I’m a Flutter Developer & Android Native Developer (Java & Kotlin)
- 👀 I’m interested in scalable mobile apps, clean architecture, and performance optimization
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced iOS development with SwiftUI to complement my cross-platform skills
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on apps that make a real impact — from MVPs to production-level products
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can build both your Flutter app and your native Android module — in the same repo 😎
